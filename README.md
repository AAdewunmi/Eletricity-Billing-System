## 4. How To Use:

I mistakenly set this project up as a maven project in netbeans instead of an ant project. The result is it will not run. So to use this project:

1.	Create your database and tables (see sql_commands.txt).
2.	Create a standard (non-maven) Java SE project.
3.	Copy all Java files into Eletricity package.
4.	Copy all jpg/png files into icon package.
5.	Install dependencies.
6.	Populate database tables (see sql_commands.txt).
7.	Run Login.java
Fingers crossed it should work first time ðŸ˜Ž
